## General Information
Using regression models, prospective housing prices are predicted.
By predicting the prospective housing prices, decisions about whether to invest in them or not can be made.
Historic housing price data is used.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Based on Lasso, the factors that generally affect the price are the Zoning classification, Living area square feet, Overall quality and condition of the house, Foundation type of the house, Number of cars that can be accomodated in the garage, Total basement area in square feet and the Basement finished square feet area
